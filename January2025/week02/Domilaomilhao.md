(*From Thousand to Million*)  

Thiago Nigro's *Do Mil ao Milhão* provides a step-by-step financial guide for achieving financial independence, focusing on three core principles: **save well**, **invest well**, and **earn well**.

## 1. Save Well: Spending Less Than You Earn  
- **Key Concept**: The path to wealth starts by controlling your spending.  
- **Practical Steps**:  
  - Track your monthly income and expenses using an app (e.g., Excel or a budgeting app).  
  - Categorize expenses into **needs**, **wants**, and **luxuries**.  
  - Set a savings target: Aim to save **at least 20% of your income**.  

- **Everyday Example**:  
  Maria earns 3000 R$ per month. She notices she spends 500 R$ on eating out. By cooking at home, she reduces this to 200 R$, saving an extra 300 R$ monthly for investments.

## 2. Invest Well: Make Your Money Work for You  
- **Key Concept**: Don’t just save money—invest it to grow.  
- **Practical Steps**:  
  - Learn about investment options like **fixed income**, **stocks**, **funds**, and **real estate**.  
  - Use the **50/30/20 rule**: Allocate 50% of savings to low-risk investments, 30% to medium risk, and 20% to high risk.  
  - Diversify your investments to reduce risks.  

- **Everyday Example**:  
  João has saved 10,000 R$. Instead of leaving it in a savings account (earning minimal interest), he invests 70% in a fixed-income fund (4% annual return) and 30% in stocks, aiming for long-term growth.

## 3. Earn Well: Increase Your Income  
- **Key Concept**: There’s a limit to how much you can save, but no limit to how much you can earn.  
- **Practical Steps**:  
  - Develop new skills to increase your value in the job market.  
  - Look for side hustles or passive income opportunities (e.g., freelancing, online courses).  
  - Network and seek mentors to unlock better opportunities.  

- **Everyday Example**:  
  Ana works full-time as a teacher but earns extra income by tutoring students online for 2 hours a day, making an additional 800 R$ per month.

## 4. The Power of Compound Interest  
- **Key Concept**: Start early to take full advantage of **compound interest**, where you earn returns not only on your investments but also on the returns themselves.  
- **Practical Steps**:  
  - Reinvest all earnings for maximum growth.  
  - Be patient: Wealth-building takes time.  

- **Everyday Example**:  
  Pedro invests 200 R$ monthly in a fund with a 10% annual return. After 10 years, he has over 40,000 R$—far more than the 24,000 R$ he originally invested.

## 5. Discipline and Consistency  
- **Key Concept**: Financial success depends on long-term consistency, not short-term gains.  
- **Practical Steps**:  
  - Automate your savings and investments to stay disciplined.  
  - Avoid emotional decisions during market fluctuations.  

- **Everyday Example**:  
  Clara sets up an automatic transfer of 500 R$ every month to an investment account, ensuring she always prioritizes saving.

## 6. Avoiding Lifestyle Inflation  
- **Key Concept**: As your income grows, don’t let your expenses grow at the same rate.  
- **Practical Steps**:  
  - Maintain your current lifestyle while increasing savings and investments.  
  - Resist the urge to upgrade unnecessarily (e.g., buying a new car when the current one works fine).  

- **Everyday Example**:  
  Lucas gets a promotion and starts earning 2000 R$ more per month. Instead of buying a new car, he saves the extra income, accelerating his wealth-building journey.

## Key Takeaway  
Achieving financial independence is a marathon, not a sprint. By following the principles of **saving**, **investing**, and **earning**, you can create a solid financial future while enjoying a fulfilling life.
